This project is an interactive 3D visual experience built using Three.js. Floating hearts move in space, and when clicked, they burst into particles and reveal a short message. The scene includes bloom effects, glowing textures, a nebula-style heart background, and subtle camera motion to create a cinematic feel.

The goal of this project is to combine creative coding with interactive design using pure JavaScript and WebGL.
